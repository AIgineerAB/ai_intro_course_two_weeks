# Exercises 

Exercises are not compulsory but very much essential to be able to understand how to implement the different concepts yourself. If you master the exercises, exam/labs/projects will be much easier to handle and in the longer perspective also your job where you'll need to apply these knowledge that you learn here.

> Use whatever tool available to solve the exercises, for example an LLM, but remember to learn the concepts and not just copy and paste code as this will slow down your learning. Also it is good to discuss with friends on how to solve the exercises. 

A key part in learning about AI field is the glossary so that you can understand and communicate efficiently to other colleagues. Therefore I usually add some glossary in the accompanying exercises that are good to learn. However note that not all the glossary is brought up in class, but some might show up in other resources.

> You can use an LLM for the glossary, but I strongly recommend you to summarize shortly in your own wordings so that you really familiarize yourself with the data language.
