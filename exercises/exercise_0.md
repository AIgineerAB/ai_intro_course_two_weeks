# Exercise 0 - working with AI

In this exercise, you get to familiarize yourself with several AI tools within generative AI.

## TODO exercises

## 0. Prompt engineering

In prompt engineering, we want to guide LLMs towards accurate, relevant and high quality AI-generated outputs. With high quality means answer that matches what is expected from you. Throughout this exercise you will start with a vague prompt and go towards more specific to try to tune the answer towards higher quality and more precise answer. 

a) Analyze what the problems are with the following prompt: "write about procurement" before typing this to an LLM.   

b) Now type in that prompt to an LLM and read the answer

c) Rewrite the initial prompt with this in mind
- clarify the goal
- define a tone
- define the output format
- add constraints

d) Explain why the new prompt is better 

e) Use this prompt template and see if you can improve the initial prompt

```md
Role:
You are a [role].

Task:
Your task is to [clear description of what you want].

Context:
Here is the relevant information:
[insert background, data, constraints, definitions]

Requirements:
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]
- [requirement 3]

Output Format:
[exact structure you want — bullets, table, JSON, step-by-step, etc.]

Constraints:
- Do not invent information.
- If unsure, say "Insufficient information."
- Keep response under [X words].
```

f) Now try to make the LLM guide you towards a better prompt by asking you questions.
