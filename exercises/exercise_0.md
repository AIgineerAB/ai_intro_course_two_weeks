# Exercise 0 - working with AI

In this exercise, you get to familiarize yourself with several AI tools within generative AI.

## 0. Prompt engineering

In prompt engineering, we want to guide LLMs towards accurate, relevant and high quality AI-generated outputs. With high quality means answer that matches what is expected from you. Throughout this exercise you will start with a vague prompt and go towards more specific to try to tune the answer towards higher quality and more precise answer. 

a) Analyze what the problems are with the following prompt: "write about procurement" before typing this to an LLM.   

b) Now type in that prompt to an LLM and read the answer

c) Rewrite the initial prompt with this in mind
- clarify the goal
- define a tone
- define the output format
- add constraints

d) Explain why the new prompt is better 

e) Use this prompt template and see if you can improve the initial prompt

```md
Role:
You are a [role].

Task:
Your task is to [clear description of what you want].

Context:
Here is the relevant information:
[insert background, data, constraints, definitions]

Requirements:
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]
- [requirement 3]

Output Format:
[exact structure you want — bullets, table, JSON, step-by-step, etc.]

Constraints:
- Do not invent information.
- If unsure, say "Insufficient information."
- Keep response under [X words].
```

f) Now try to make the LLM guide you towards a better prompt by asking you questions. 


## 1. Deep research about AI and its impact on jobs

Perform deep research about how AI impacts jobs in a particular geographical area of you choice (e.g. Sweden). Before you do the deep research, prompt an LLM to write a suitable prompt for the research for you. Then modify the prompt to suit your needs, then input it into a deep research. 

## 2. Use guided learning to learn about AI ethics

Use guided learning or study mode to learn about AI ethics. Put in the following prompt into guided learning or study mode

```md
You are my AI learning mentor.



I am a beginner who wants to understand AI ethics and AI security from scratch.



Your job is to guide me step-by-step like a structured mini-course.



Rules:

- Assume I have no technical background.

- Use simple language.

- Give real-world examples.

- After each section, ask me 2–3 reflection questions.

- Include small practical exercises.

- Build gradually from basic concepts to slightly more advanced topics.

- Keep each lesson concise but clear.

- If I say “go deeper,” expand the topic technically.



Structure the learning into modules:



Module 1: What is AI ethics?

- Define AI ethics

- Why it matters

- Real-world examples (bias, misinformation, privacy)



Module 2: Core ethical principles

- Fairness

- Transparency

- Accountability

- Privacy

- Safety

```




## 2. Theory questions

You can use LLM to find answer on these questions, but you should definitiely summarize the answers in your own wordings to learn as much as possible.

&nbsp; a) What is generative AI?

&nbsp; b) What is the purpose of prompt engineering?

&nbsp; c) What is an "AI hallucination," and why do Large Language Models (LLMs) produce them despite being trained on massive datasets?

&nbsp; d) Why use lerning mode, when you can just prompt an LLM normally?

&nbsp; e) What are the differences between zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot learning?
